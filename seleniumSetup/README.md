# Selenium Setup

To use selenium you need to use a webdriver which is a seperate file that must be in your path.

## Folder Contents
* Script
* Chromedriver (to operate Chrome) 64-bit linux driver
* Geckodriver (to operate Firefox) 64-bit linux driver

The script simply adds this folder to path so that Selenium can find the Chrome/Geckodriver.
