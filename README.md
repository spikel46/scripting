#flux
*script to start flux
*script to kill flux
*im sure theres tons of stuff i could do to improve this. probably adding a script to create a cron job to make sure its running every day.... or maybe something in bash...

#password path  
*script to remind me how to automate outputting stuff to bash so I can have path variables.
*can be improved with conditionals

#selenium setup
*script to add folder to path. Selenium with firefox needs the folder containing geckodriver to be in path, so this accomplishes that without the need for hard-coding.
*could probably be improved by adding chromedriver... but eh

#probability hw
*script to automate creating a latex document that will contain my homework.
*can improve by actually adding problem text (might have issues with mathematical equations... ocr??)
